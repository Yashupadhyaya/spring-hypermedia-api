================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unsafe Object Comparison (CWE-597)
Issue: The equals() function is not validating proper object type, which could lead to improperly equality checks and further unforeseen issues or vulnerabilities.
Solution: You should use 'instanceof' keyword before casting. This will make sure that if the types are not equal, the method will not throw ClassCastException and return false.

Vulnerability: Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)
Issue: The code lacks null check validations, which can lead to Null Pointer Exceptions if you are trying to access methods or attributes of a null object.
Solution: You should always use objects utility for null-safe methods calling equals() to prevent Null Pointer Exceptions.

================================================================================
""" 
Scenario 1: Testing for a successful comparison when the object is equal to itself

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsForSameObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that an object is equal to itself. 
Execution:
  Arrange: We create a Book object book1.
  Act: We invoke the equals method on book1, using book1 as a parameter.
  Assert: We assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  This is to verify that an object always equals itself following the definition of the equals method. It is significant to validate the reflexivity of the equals method for consistency in application behavior.

Scenario 2: Testing comparison with null object
  
Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsForNullObject
  Description: This test is to verify if the equals method correctly identifies that the object is not equal to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: We create a Book object book1.
  Act: We invoke the equals method on book1 with a null parameter.
  Assert: We assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  An object should never be equal to null as per the definition of the equals method. This test is significant to ensure that the correct result is returned when comparing an object with null.

Scenario 3: Testing comparison with a different class object

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsForDifferentClassObject
  Description: This tests if the equals method correctly identifies that the object from a different class is not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: We create a Book object book1, and another object of a different class.
  Act: We invoke the equals method on book1 using the different class object as a parameter.
  Assert: We assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  This is to validate that objects of different classes can never be equal. The significance of this test lies in maintaining the consistency of the equals method in the application.

Scenario 4: Testing comparison with different Book objects 

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsForDifferentBookObjects
  Description: This tests if equals method correctly identifies that two different Book objects are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: We create two different Book objects, book1 and book2 with different author, title, and isbn.
  Act: We invoke equals method on book1, using book2 as a parameter.
  Assert: We assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  This validates that two different Book instances are not equal. This is significant to the context of application behavior in comparing two distinct books.

Scenario 5: Testing comparison for Book objects with the same details

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsForSameBookDetails
  Description: This tests if equals method correctly identifies that two Book objects with the same details are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: We create two different Book objects, book1 and book2 with the same author, title, and isbn.
  Act: We invoke equals method on book1 using book2 as a parameter.
  Assert: We assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  This validates that two Book instances with the same details are considered equal. This test reflects the practical scenario where two books can be considered the same if their attributes match.
