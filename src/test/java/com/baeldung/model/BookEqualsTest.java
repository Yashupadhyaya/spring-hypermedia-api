================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unchecked Type Cast
Issue: In the equals method, there is a potential for 'ClassCastException' since 'obj' is being directly casted to 'Book'. This can lead to runtime errors if 'obj' is not of type 'Book'.
Solution: Check if the object is an instance of the class before casting. Modify the equals method to: if (!(obj instanceof Book)) return false; Book other = (Book) obj;

Vulnerability: Null Check
Issue: The equals method checks multiple times if the parameter's fields such as author, isbn, and title are not 'null'. In complex objects, this may produce excessive null checks, leading to error-prone code.
Solution: Instead of multiple null checks, consider using Objects.equals(this.field, other.field) for comparing fields. This method handles 'null' internally.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent equals and hashCode
Issue: If you override equals, you should also override hashCode. This is to ensure that when two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, they must also have the same hashCode. Otherwise, it violates the contract of the hashCode method and might result in strange and bugs related to data structures like HashSet, HashMap, etc.
Solution: Besides the equals method, you should also override the hashCode method to ensure consistency.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test with the same book object
Details:
    TestName: testWithSameBookObject.
    Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when the same book object is passed.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a Book object.
    Act: Pass the same object to the equals method.
    Assert: Verify that the equals method returns true.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return true when the same object is used because it is identical. This test validates that the method correctly recognizes identical instances.

Scenario 2: Test with null object
Details:
    TestName: testWithNullObject.
    Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when a null object is passed.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a Book object.
    Act: Pass a null object to the equals method.
    Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false when a null object is passed. This test confirms that the method accurately recognizes null inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with different class object
Details:
    TestName: testWithDifferentClassObject.
    Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when an object of a different class is passed.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Create a Book object and an object of a different class.
    Act: Pass the different class object to the equals method.
    Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false when an object of a different class is passed. This test checks that the method implements the class comparison correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with books having different authors
Details:
    TestName: testWithDifferentAuthors.
    Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when the authors of the books are not the same.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Create two Book objects with different authors.
    Act: Pass one book object to the equals method of the other.
    Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false if the authors of the books are not the same. This test ensures that the author comparison logic in the method is correct.

Scenario 5: Test with books having same ISBN and title but different authors
Details:
    TestName: testWithSameIsbnAndTitleButDifferentAuthors.
    Description: This test validates if the equals method returns false when the ISBN and Titles are the same, but authors are different.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Create two Book objects with same ISBN and title but different authors.
    Act: Pass one book object to the equals method of the other.
    Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false if the authors are different even though the ISBN and Titles are same. This test ensures that the method accurately takes all properties into account when comparing instances.
