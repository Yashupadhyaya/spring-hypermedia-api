ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=equals_039c844c47

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incorrect Override of equals() method
Issue: The provided equals() method doesn't check for the instance of the object before casting, which could lead to a ClassCastException.
Solution: Ensure to check if the object is an instance of the class before casting. The equals() method should first check if the object is an instance of the class using the instanceof keyword.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when the compared objects are the same

Details:  
  TestName: equalsSameObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns true when the same object is compared to itself. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and set its author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the Book object to itself.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that an object is equal to itself. The expected result is true because, by definition, an object is always equal to itself.

Scenario 2: Test when the compared objects are null

Details:  
  TestName: equalsNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when the compared object is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and set its author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the Book object to null.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that an object is not equal to null. The expected result is false because an object is never equal to null.

Scenario 3: Test when the compared objects are of different classes

Details:  
  TestName: equalsDifferentClass
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when the compared object is of a different class. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object and another object of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the Book object to the other object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that objects of different classes are not equal. The expected result is false because objects of different classes are never equal.

Scenario 4: Test when the compared objects have different authors

Details:  
  TestName: equalsDifferentAuthors
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when the compared Book objects have different authors. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with the same isbn and title but different authors.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the two Book objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that Book objects with different authors are not equal. The expected result is false because Book objects with different authors are not considered equal.

Scenario 5: Test when the compared objects have different isbns

Details:  
  TestName: equalsDifferentIsbns
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when the compared Book objects have different isbns. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with the same author and title but different isbns.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the two Book objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that Book objects with different isbns are not equal. The expected result is false because Book objects with different isbns are not considered equal.

Scenario 6: Test when the compared objects have different titles

Details:  
  TestName: equalsDifferentTitles
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when the compared Book objects have different titles. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with the same author and isbn but different titles.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the two Book objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that Book objects with different titles are not equal. The expected result is false because Book objects with different titles are not considered equal.

Scenario 7: Test when the compared objects are equal

Details:  
  TestName: equalsSameBook
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns true when the compared Book objects have the same author, isbn, and title. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with the same author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, comparing the two Book objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that Book objects with the same author, isbn, and title are equal. The expected result is true because Book objects with the same author, isbn, and title are considered equal.
