================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: If user inputs are directly used in SQL queries without sanitization or prepared statements, it can lead to SQL Injection attacks where an attacker can manipulate the query.
Solution: Use prepared statements or sanitize user inputs before using in SQL queries.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
Issue: If user inputs are directly used in web pages without sanitization, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting attacks where an attacker can inject malicious scripts.
Solution: Sanitize user inputs before using in web pages or use frameworks that automatically escape user inputs.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (CWE-932)
Issue: If object references are directly exposed to users, it can lead to unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Use indirect object references or check for authorization before providing access to objects.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to Validate the Title

Details:  
  TestName: testGetTitle.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getTitle() method. The target scenario is when the method is called to retrieve the title of an entity. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mock data is required as the getTitle() method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual title returned by the method against the expected title.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getTitle() method correctly retrieves the title of an entity. The expected result is the same title that was set for the entity. The test is significant as it confirms the correct behavior of the getTitle() method, which is crucial for retrieving entity information.

Scenario 2: Test to Check Null Title

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNullTitle.
  Description: This test is meant to check the getTitle() method when the title of an entity is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the title of the entity to null.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the getTitle() method returns null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to confirm that the getTitle() method can handle null values and return null when the title of an entity is not set. This test is significant as it tests the resilience of the getTitle() method to null values.

Scenario 3: Test to Check Empty Title

Details:  
  TestName: testGetEmptyTitle.
  Description: This test is meant to check the getTitle() method when the title of an entity is an empty string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the title of the entity to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the getTitle() method returns an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to confirm that the getTitle() method can handle empty strings and return an empty string when the title of an entity is not set. This test is significant as it tests the resilience of the getTitle() method to empty strings.
