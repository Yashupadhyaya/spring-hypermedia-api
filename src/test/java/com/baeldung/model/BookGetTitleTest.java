================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
Issue: The 'title' property of this unspecified Java class has a public getter method.  If not handled properly, this can lead to data exposure or improper access control.
Solution: Ensure that there is object-level access control enforced for this property. Consider making the getter method protected or package-private if not required to be public.

Vulnerability: Logging Sensitive info (CWE-532)
Issue: If this entity contains sensitive information, then logging its contents in debugging or error outputs may reveal that information.
Solution: Mark sensitive fields with the `@JsonIgnore` annotation to exclude them from default logging

Vulnerability: JSON Injection (CWE-93)
Issue: If this object is used to accept user inputs, there is potential for JSON injection attacks if not properly sanitized.
Solution: Strongly validate and sanitize user inputs. Consider using `@JsonCreator` and `@JsonProperty` for controlled deserialization.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If the ID of an object is exposed to client-side, attackers may manipulate these references to gain unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Avoid exposing direct object references to users. Implement access control checks before returning any data to the client.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check whether getTitle() returns expected value

Details:
  TestName: getTitleReturnExpectedValue
  Description: The getTitle method should return the value of title string as stored in the object. This test is intended to confirm that the correct stored value is accurately returned.
Execution:
  Arrange:Create an instance of the class and set its title string to a known value.
  Act: Call the getTitle() method.
  Assert: Check using JUnit assertEquals that the returned value matches the value set earlier.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that getTitle() returns the correct title value as set in the object. This is essential to ensure that the getter method is operating correctly, and accurately fetching the title value from the object instance.

Scenario 2: Test to check getTitle() for a newly created instance

Details:
  TestName: getTitleForNewInstance
  Description: For a newly created instance where title is not set, the getTitle() method should return null or default value depending on implementation. This test is to ensure that null/default value is returned in such a case.
Execution:
  Arrange:Create a new instance of the class without setting its title value.
  Act: Call the getTitle() method.
  Assert:Check using JUnit assertNotNull or assertEquals that the returned value is null or default value as per implementation.
Validation:
  This test confirms that getTitle() does not throw an error and returns expected value when the title field hasn't been initialized. It validates the robustness of the method's error handling and its resilience to unexpected states.

Scenario 3: Test to check whether getTitle() returns the last assigned title value

Details:
  TestName: getTitleReturnsLastAssignedValue
  Description: The getTitle method should return the most recent value assigned to title. This test checks whether the function consistently returns the most recently assigned value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set its title value, then change it to a new expected value.
  Act: Call the getTitle() method.
  Assert: Check using JUnit assertEquals that the returned value matches the expected value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that getTitle() always returns the current title value even if it has been changed multiple times. This is critical for ensuring that the function accurately and reliably retrieves the current state of the title field.
