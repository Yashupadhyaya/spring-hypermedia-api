================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: This vulnerability can manifest when sensitive information such as ISBN is passed over HTTP/S GET requests, potentially exposing it in log files and other locations.
Solution: Instead of using GET requests for sensitive information, use POST or PUT requests. If it must be a GET request, make sure that the sensitive information is part of the HTTP/S Body content, not the URL.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: Exposing setter methods for sensitive fields can potentially allow unauthorized modification or access to sensitive data.
Solution: Consider removing setter methods for sensitive fields. If setter methods are necessary, make sure access control measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access.

"""
Scenario 1: ISBN is set with a valid string

Details:  
  TestName: testValidSetIsbn.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the setIsbn method correctly sets the isbn. In this scenario, we assume that a properly formatted isbn string is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new object of the class. Initialize a string containing a valid isbn.
    Act: Invoke the setIsbn method with the string created in the arrange step. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the current isbn value of the object with the expected isbn value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is meant to verify that the isbn value of the object was updated correctly. The expected result is that the isbn values will match.

Scenario 2: ISBN is set with an empty string

Details:  
  TestName: testEmptySetIsbn.
  Description: This test is aimed to check how the setIsbn method responds when given an input of an empty string. In this scenario, it is anticipated that the string is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new object of the class. Initialize an empty string.
    Act: Use the setIsbn method to set the isbn of the object to the empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the isbn value of the object has been updated to an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the isbn value of the object has changed to an empty string. If the isbn value has been updated correctly, it means the code is tolerant of cases in which an isbn is not provided.

Scenario 3: ISBN is set as null

Details:  
  TestName: testNullSetIsbn.
  Description: This test intends to check the setIsbn method's behavior when the input is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object of the class.
    Act: Apply the setIsbn method to the isbn of the object, with null as the argument.
    Assert: Using JUnit assertions, confirm if the isbn of the object is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to show that the isbn of the object is null. This test is important as it checks to see if a null value is suitably managed by the method.
