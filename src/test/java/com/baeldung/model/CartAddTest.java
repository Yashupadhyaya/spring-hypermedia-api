================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method add does not perform any validation before adding the bookToAdd object to the books collection. If the bookToAdd object is null or otherwise invalid, it could lead to unexpected behavior or a Null Pointer Exception.
Solution: Validate the input before using it. In this case, check if bookToAdd is not null before adding it to the books collection.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the Book object contains any sensitive data, and if the books collection is publicly accessible, this could lead to exposure of sensitive data.
Solution: Ensure that the books collection is private and only accessible through getter methods. Also, consider using a copy of the Book object (implementing Cloneable interface or a copy constructor) instead of the actual object to prevent possible data manipulation.

Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: If the Book object contains a file or allows for file upload, without proper validation and restrictions, it could allow for unrestricted upload of files of a dangerous type.
Solution: Implement proper validation and restrictions on file uploads, including checking the file type, size, and content.

"""
Scenario 1: Add a valid book to the list

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddValidBook
    Description: This test is meant to check if a valid book object can be added to the 'books' list successfully. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new book object with valid data.
    Act: Invoke the add method with the new book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the book object is in the 'books' list.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the book has been added to the list. The expected result is that the book should be in the list after the add method is called. This is significant as it shows the basic functionality of the add method is working.

Scenario 2: Add a null book to the list

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddNullBook
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the add method when a null book object is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null book object.
    Act: Invoke the add method with the null book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if a NullPointerException is thrown when a null book is added. The expected result is that a NullPointerException should be thrown. This is significant as it tests the error handling of the add method.

Scenario 3: Add a book that already exists in the list

  Details:  
    TestName: testAddExistingBook
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the add method when a book that already exists in the 'books' list is added again. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new book object and add it to the 'books' list. Then, create another book object with the same data.
    Act: Invoke the add method with the second book object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the 'books' list contains two instances of the book.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the 'books' list contains two instances of the book after the add method is called with the same book data. The expected result is that the 'books' list should contain two instances of the book. This is significant as it shows the add method does not check for duplicate entries.
