================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Java: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If an application exposes direct references to internal implementation objects, like database keys or file names, it may allow unauthorized access.
Solution: Rather than directly exposing objects, use indirect references mapped to the actual objects. Access control checks should be in place to validate if a user is authorized to access the targeted object.

"""
Scenario 1: Test if the synopsis is set correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSynopsisSetCorrectly
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setSynopsis correctly assigns the provided string to the synopsis attribute. The target scenario is a regular usage of the method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string to be assigned as synopsis.
  Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with the prepared string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the synopsis attribute is equal to the provided string.
Validation: 
  If the test passes, it verifies that setSynopsis method performs the assignment correctly. Its importance lies in ensuring that the synopsis information is accurately recorded in the object.

Scenario 2: Setting a null synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: testSettingNullSynopsis
  Description: This test aims to validate the behavior of the setSynopsis method when a null string is passed. This is an edge case scenario. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a null string.
  Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with the null string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the synopsis attribute is null.
Validation: 
  If the test passes, it verifies that the method can handle null inputs. This is important because null values may occasionally be passed due to user errors or system glitches.

Scenario 3: Setting an empty synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: testSettingEmptySynopsis
  Description: This test measures the setSynopsis method's response to empty strings. It's an edge case scenario. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with the empty string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the synopsis attribute is an empty string.
Validation:
  If the test succeeds, it verifies that the method can effectively manage empty strings. This is significant because the user may occasionally enter an empty synopsis, and we must ensure that this is handled correctly. 

Scenario 4: Setting a very long synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: testSettingLongSynopsis
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setSynopsis method when it receives a very long string. This is a boundary scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string that is longer than the maximum allowed length. 
  Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with the long string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the appropriate behavior. Depending on the implementation, the synopsis attribute might be truncated, or an error might be thrown. 
Validation: 
  If the test passes, it validates how the method deals with values above its expected input length. This is important to ensure stability and robustness of the method under unusual circumstances.
