================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: Returning a direct reference to the private list may allow external code to change your list.
Solution: Return a copy of the list or an unmodifiable list. This can be achieved using Collections.unmodifiableList(books) or new ArrayList<>(books).

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If Book objects contain sensitive information, it can be exposed to any code that has access to the returned list.
Solution: Ensure that the Book object does not expose sensitive data. If necessary, use a Data Transfer Object (DTO) to restrict the data that is made accessible.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation
Issue: If the Book objects are used in further processing and these objects are not validated, it could lead to various vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always validate input data, regardless of its source. This includes data from getter methods.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the successful retrieval of a list of books

Details:  
TestName: testGetBooksSuccessfully
Description: This test is meant to check if the getBooks() method successfully retrieves a list of books. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of books and add it to the book list.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual list of books returned against the expected list of books.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getBooks() method correctly retrieves the list of books. The expected result is the list of books we created and added to the book list. This test is significant in checking the basic functionality of the getBooks() method.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the retrieval of an empty list of books

Details:  
TestName: testGetBooksWhenListIsEmpty
Description: This test is meant to check if the getBooks() method returns an empty list when there are no books in the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the list of books is empty.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual list of books returned against an empty list.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getBooks() method correctly retrieves an empty list when there are no books. The expected result is an empty list. This test is significant in checking the behavior of the getBooks() method when the book list is empty.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the retrieval of a null list of books

Details:  
TestName: testGetBooksWhenListIsNull
Description: This test is meant to check if the getBooks() method returns null when the list of books is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the list of books to null.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual list of books returned against null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getBooks() method correctly retrieves null when the list of books is null. The expected result is null. This test is significant in checking the behavior of the getBooks() method when the book list is null.
