================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: In cases where the 'Book' objects contain sensitive information, returning a direct reference through 'getBooks()' method can lead to unauthorized information disclosure or alteration if not properly handled.
Solution: Ensure appropriate access controls are implemented to prevent unauthorized users from accessing or modifying data. This might involve checking the user's privileges or roles before processing their request.

Vulnerability: Missing Encapsulation or CWE-668
Issue: By directly exposing the list of books, you risk violating the principles of encapsulation. If the list is mutable, bad actors can gain unintended access or manipulate the list.
Solution: Return a read-only view of the list or a deep copy of the list. This can be achieved using 'Collections.unmodifiableList()' for a read-only list or by creating a new list with copied content.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Books List is not empty

Details:  
    TestName: checkBooksListPresent
    Description: The test will check if the 'getBooks()' function returns the correct list of books when there are books available.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Generate a list of books and assign it to the 'books' variable.
    Act: Invoke the 'getBooks()' method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned list matches the 'books' list generated during the arrangement.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the 'getBooks()' method returns an accurate list of books. This is crucial as it interacts with the list of books, which warrants correct functioning.

Scenario 2: No Books are available

Details:  
    TestName: checkNoBooksAvailable
    Description: The test will check whether the 'getBooks()' function returns an empty list if no books are available.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set 'books' variable to a new, empty ArrayList of type 'Book'.
    Act: Invoke the 'getBooks()' method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned list is empty.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if the 'getBooks()' method correctly handles the case where no books are available. It is essential to ensure that irrespective of the books condition, the method returns accurate data ensuring application robustness.

Scenario 3: Books list returned is not modifiable

Details:  
    TestName: checkReturnedBooksListIsUnmodifiable
    Description: The test will check if the list returned by the 'getBooks()' method cannot be modified to ensure data consistency.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Generate a list of books and assign it to the 'books' variable.
    Act: Invoke the 'getBooks()' method and try adding new book to the returned list.
    Assert: Assert that UnsupportedOperationException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks that the list returned by 'getBooks()' is unmodifiable ensuring that data consistency is maintained and unexpected modification operations are avoided.
