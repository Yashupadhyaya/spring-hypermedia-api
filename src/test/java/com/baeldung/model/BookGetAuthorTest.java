================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) / CWE-639
Issue: If 'author' is an entity that's directly exposed to the user, it can potentially lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
Solution: Ensure there is a proper access control mechanism in place, so that the user can only access data they are authorized to.

Vulnerability: JSON Injection / CWE-94
Issue: Using '@JsonView' without proper validation could lead to JSON Injection attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious JSON content.
Solution: Ensure that there is proper input validation and sanitization in place when using '@JsonView' or similar annotations.

Vulnerability: Insecure Data Exposure / CWE-200
Issue: Using '@JsonIgnore' may lead to exposure of sensitive data, if not used carefully. If sensitive fields are not properly ignored, they could be exposed in the JSON response.
Solution: Always ensure that sensitive data is properly ignored and not exposed in the JSON response. Also, ensure that data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection / CWE-89
Issue: If user input is directly used in SQL queries or if ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) entities are not set up properly, it can lead to SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user input. Make use of prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks.

Scenario 1: Validate the return value of getAuthor method

Details:  
  TestName: validateGetAuthorReturnValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAuthor method returns the correct author name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a string variable with the expected author name.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of getAuthor method against the expected author name.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the getAuthor method returns the correct author name as expected. This test is significant in ensuring that the method works correctly and returns accurate data.

Scenario 2: Validate the return type of getAuthor method

Details:  
  TestName: validateGetAuthorReturnType
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAuthor method returns a string type data. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No data setup required.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the return type of the getAuthor method is a string.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the getAuthor method returns data of type string. This test is significant in ensuring that the method is consistent with its return type.

Scenario 3: Validate the getAuthor method when the author is null

Details:  
  TestName: validateGetAuthorWhenNull
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAuthor method returns null when the author is not set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the author field is not set.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of getAuthor method against null.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the getAuthor method returns null when the author is not set. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles null values correctly.
