================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If any method of this entity class is manipulating SQL queries using string concatenation with unsanitized input, it can lead to SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or JPA's Criteria API to prevent SQL Injection.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: Without proper authentication and authorization controls, unauthorized users might fetch sensitive information.
Solution: Implement proper authentication and authorization controls. Adopt the principle of least privilege.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If the ‘author’ field holds sensitive data and its getter method is exposed without suitable protection, it can lead to information exposure.
Solution: Ensure sensitive fields are properly protected and not unnecessarily exposed.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: If the class or its methods have improper access modification, it could lead to unintended object access.
Solution: Apply appropriate access modulators to classes and methods. Private should be the default access level, and others should be granted as necessary.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to validate the return value of getAuthor() method when author is fetched

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorReturnValue 
  Description: This test is meant to check if the correct author name is returned by the getAuthor() method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a model object with a known author name. 
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor() method to get the author name from the model. 
  Assert: Compare the returned author name to the expected one.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAuthor() method is correctly fetching the author name. If the expected and actual author names match then the getAuthor() method is working as expected. This test ensures the core functionality of fetching the author's name is intact.

Scenario 2: Empty String Check

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorEmptyStringValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAuthor() method returns empty string when no author name is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a model object without any author name (empty string). 
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor() method. 
  Assert: Check if returned value is an empty string. 
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking to see if an empty string is returned when no author name is provided. If the assertion passes, we can confirm that the getAuthor() method works correctly when no author name is present.

Scenario 3: Null Value Check

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAuthor() method handles null author name correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a model object with author name as null. 
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor() method.
  Assert: Check if returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking to see if null is returned when author name is null. If the assertion passes, we can confirm that the getAuthor() method works correctly when author name is null. 

Scenario 4: Test to validate the return type of getAuthor()

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorReturnType
  Description: This test is to verify if the return type of getAuthor() method is a String.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a model object with an author name.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor() method.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is an instance of String.
Validation: 
  The assertion is to verify the return type of the getAuthor() method. If the return type is String, the test passes which ensures the application’s behaviour is as desired.
