================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: Typically happens when data is directly printed to an HTTP response without being properly, this can lead to injection attacks.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize input, even if it comes from trusted sources. Use output encoding APIs provided by your web language or framework.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection
Issue: Happens when queries are directly constructed from user input, allowing potential attackers to manipulate queries.
Solution: Use parameterized queries, SQL prepared statements or ORM libraries to prevent SQL injection.

Vulnerability: Missing or Incomplete Authentication/Authorization
Issue: If the application does not properly verify the identity of its users, it can be subject to unauthorized use.
Solution: Implement strong authentication and authorization checks throughout the application. Use well-tested authentication and authorization frameworks.

Vulnerability: Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
Issue: Allowing access to objects directly without checking if the user has the required permissions.
Solution: Ensure object IDs cannot be modified by users and implement proper access controls.

Vulnerability: Data Leakages
Issue: Sensitive data may be leaked through error messages, API responses, logs, etc.
Solution: Avoid displaying raw exceptions or stack traces to users. Limit and mask data returned in API responses to only what is necessary. Enable logging for security-related events.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check getAuthor Method When a Valid Author Name Is Present

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorWhenAuthorNameIsPresent.
  Description: The test is designed to validate that the function returns the correct author name when the Author field is populated.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock object with a valid author name.
    Act: Invoke the getAuthor() method of the mock object. 
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to check if the returned author name matches the set author name.
  Validation: 
    This will confirm that the getAuthor() function correctly retrieves the valid author name in normal scenarios. This is crucial because the author name access is an essential part of this application's functionality.

Scenario 2: Check getAuthor Method When Author Field is Null

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorWhenAuthorNameIsNull.
  Description: This test is intended to check the getAuthor() function's handling of null values, which is a common edge case.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock object with null assigned to the author name.
    Act: Call the getAuthor() method on the mock object.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to confirm that the returned author name is null.
  Validation: 
    Verifying the function's correct behavior when the author field is null will contribute to its robustness and reliability. It ensures that the function can handle missing values without throwing exceptions or faults.

Scenario 3: Check getAuthor Method When Empty String is Assigned to Author Field

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorWhenAuthorIsEmptyString. 
  Description: This test aims to validate if the getAuthor() method can gracefully handle edge cases where the author name is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a mock object with the author name set to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getAuthor() method on the object.
    Assert: Make a JUnit assertion to verify that the returned author name is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    Meaningful results from this test help ensure that the method can deal with non-null but empty fields without disrupting the application's behavior or performance. This is an important aspect of maintaining the application's stability while managing different circumstances of data input.
