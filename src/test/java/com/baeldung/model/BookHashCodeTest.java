================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The Java code uses a hardcoded 'prime' number value in the hashcode calculation which can lead to predictable output and potential hash collision. This could be further exploited in data structure scenarios like HashMap, causing performance degradation. This also can lead to vulnerabilities around confidentiality, integrity and availability.
Solution: Consider generating and using sufficiently random values in your hashcode calculations. In addition, be sure to appropriately handle potential collisions in hash-based collections or databases.

Vulnerability: CWE-203: Information Exposure Through Discrepancy
Issue: The hashCode method reveals information about the internal state of the object. This could potentially be used for further attacks. Also, because the hashCode for null checks is hardcoded, an attacker could potentially guess the hashCode values.
Solution: It's recommended to not expose any information about the internal state of the object. You could also consider using 'Objects.hashCode()' for null-safe hash code calculations.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test the hashCode method with valid 'author', 'isbn', and 'title'
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithValidData
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode function when valid 'author', 'isbn', and 'title' are provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class with a valid 'author', 'isbn', and 'title'
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashcode matches the expected hashcode.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method works correctly with valid inputs. 
    The significance of the test is to confirm that two separate instances containing the same data produce the same hashcode for ensuring data consistency and uniformity.

Scenario 2: Test the hashCode method when 'author' is null
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullAuthor
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode function when the 'author' property is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class with null 'author', valid 'isbn', and 'title'.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashcode matches the expected hashcode.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method handles null values appropriately, and still generates a hashcode. 
    This test assures that null property values will not break the hashCode function and can produce consistent hashcodes.

Scenario 3: Test the hashCode method when 'isbn' is null
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullIsbn
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when the 'isbn' property is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class with valid 'author', null 'isbn', and 'title'.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashcode matches the expected hashcode.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method handles null values appropriately, and still generates a hashcode. 
    This test assures that null property values will not break the hashCode function and can produce consistent hashcodes.

Scenario 4: Test the hashCode method when 'title' is null
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullTitle
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when the 'title' property is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class with valid 'author', 'isbn', and null 'title'.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashcode matches the expected hashcode.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method handles null values appropriately, and still generates a hashcode. 
    This test assures that null property values will not break the hashCode function and can produce consistent hashcodes.

Scenario 5: Test the hashCode method when 'author', 'isbn' and 'title' are all null
Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithAllNull
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when all properties 'author', 'isbn' and 'title' are null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class with null 'author', 'isbn', and 'title'.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashcode matches the expected hashcode.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method handles all null values appropriately, and still generates a hashcode.
    This test assures that null property values will not break the hashCode function and can produce consistent hashcodes.
