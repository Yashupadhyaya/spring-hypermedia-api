================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-328: Reversible One-Way Hash
Issue: The hashCode() function is being used for data integrity checks. However, the function is not designed to be collision-resistant and may return the same value for different inputs, presenting a potential data integrity issue.
Solution: Consider using a collision-resistant hash function when implementing data integrity checks, such as the SHA-256 algorithm available in the java.security.MessageDigest class.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: hashCode() outputs are being determined by private data fields (author, isbn and title). This may lead to exposure of sensitive information if the hash codes are handled improperly or used inappropriately.
Solution: Ensure careful handling of hash codes derived from private information. Consider not using sensitive information when generating hash codes or make sure the output does not reveal any significant information about the hashed data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The hashCode() function is declared in the global scope, and not within a class or object. This may be a leftover from debugging which could cause unexpected behaviors.
Solution: Place function definitions in the appropriate scope. Remove any debugging code or isolate it using conditional statements to prevent it from running in production.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Validate the hashCode function with valid non-null inputs
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithValidNonNullValues
    Description: This test checks the correct execution and response of the hashCode method when valid non-null author, isbn, and title are provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an object with non-null author, isbn, and title.
    Act: Call hashCode function on this object.
    Assert: The returned integer should be as expected after calculation. 
  Validation: 
    The aim is to validate if hashCode returns the correct and consistent hash value for non-null inputs. This is important to successfully map and retrieve objects using their hash values.

Scenario 2: Validate the hashCode function with all null inputs
  Details: 
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullValues
    Description: This test aims to verify the behavior of the hashCode method when all inputs (author, isbn, and title) are null.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an object with null author, isbn, and title.
    Act: Call hashCode on this object.
    Assert: The returned integer value should be 1 as per the method.
  Validation: 
    The test confirms that the method properly handles null values and still produces a valid hash code due to the initial result being encrypted with 1.

Scenario 3: Validate the hashCode function with some null and some non-null inputs
  Details: 
    TestName: testHashCodeWithMixedValues
    Description: This test will evaluate the correctness and reliability of the hashCode method when provided with a mix of null and non-null inputs.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an object with null and non-null mix of author, isbn, and title.
    Act: Call hashCode function on this object.
    Assert: The returned integer should be expected after calculation based on provided inputs.
  Validation: 
    This test helps in ensuring that the hashCode function behaves as expected even with a mix of null and non-null inputs and successfully produces a valid hash.

Scenario 4: Validate the hashCode function with same inputs more than once
  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
    Description: Testing if the hashCode function generates the same hash code every time when called multiple times with same set of inputs. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an object with certain author, isbn, and title.
    Act: Call hashCode function on this object multiple times.
    Assert: The returned integer should be consistent across multiple calls.
  Validation: 
    We want to ensure the returned hash is consistent and doesn't change across multiple invocations with same set of inputs. This is important to maintain the integrity of the objects.
