================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If the 'prime' used in the hashCode method is predictable, this could lead to potential hash collisions, resulting in performance issues or even denial of service attacks.
Solution: Ensure that the 'prime' is sufficiently random and not predictable. Consider using a secure random number generator for this purpose.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The hashCode method does not check if 'author', 'isbn', or 'title' are null before calling their hashCode methods, potentially leading to a NullPointerException.
Solution: Always check if objects are null before calling their methods. In this case, you could use Java 8's Objects.hashCode() method which is null-safe.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the hashCode method is used for debugging and not removed in the production environment, it could leak sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that debugging code is properly gated and cannot be executed in a production environment.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Valid hashCode generation for all non-null fields
Details:  
  TestName: generateHashCodeNonNullFields
  Description: This test is designed to check the hashCode method when all fields (author, isbn, title) are non-null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields set to non-null values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance. 
  Assert: Check if the returned hashCode is not zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode returned is not zero when all fields are non-null. This is based on the logic in the hashCode method, which adds the hashCodes of all non-null fields. This test ensures that the hashCode method operates correctly on non-null values.

Scenario 2: Valid hashCode generation with null fields
Details:  
  TestName: generateHashCodeNullFields
  Description: This test is designed to check the hashCode method when one or more fields (author, isbn, title) are null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with one or more fields set to null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance. 
  Assert: Check if the returned hashCode is not negative.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode returned is not negative when one or more fields are null. This is based on the logic in the hashCode method, which adds zero to the result for each null field. This test ensures that the hashCode method handles null values correctly.

Scenario 3: Consistency of hashCode
Details:  
  TestName: hashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test is designed to check the consistency of the hashCode method, i.e., it should return the same hashCode for the same object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with specific values for all fields.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance multiple times. 
  Assert: Check if the returned hashCodes are equal.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the same hashCode is returned for the same object. This is crucial for the correct operation of hash-based collections. This test ensures that the hashCode method is consistent.
