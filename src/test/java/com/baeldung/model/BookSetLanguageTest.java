================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Uncontrolled Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The 'setLanguage' method can be misused to change the language, potentially leading to an inconsistent state or unintentional behavior in multilingual applications if inputs are not validated.
Solution: Implement checks in 'setLanguage' method to validate the input against a list of supported languages before assigning it to 'this.language'. This way, we can ensure that only valid and intended operations are performed.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'setLanguage' method does not perform any validation of input data. This can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, and security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Inputs should always be validated before use in any scenario. Implement data validation checks to ensure that the input language is in an expected format.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The code uses the 'setLanguage' method which can be risky if used without due caution, potentially leading to application instability or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Examine the function's usage throughout the codebase, evaluate its necessity in each context, and consider eliminating its use or replacing it with safer alternatives where possible.

"""
Scenario 1: Setting the Language with a valid input
Details:  
  TestName: testSetLanguageWithValidInput
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the language of the object can be correctly set given a valid language input.  
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object, and define a valid language string.
  Act: Invoke the setLanguage method with the valid string as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the object's language property against the expected language string.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the language can be successfully set on the object when a valid input is provided. The expected result is the string that was passed into the setLanguage method, this is used to verify if the function is setting the language as expected. This is important for ensuring that the method correctly sets its related attribute.

Scenario 2: Setting the Language with a null input
Details:  
  TestName: testSetLanguageWithNullInput
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the language of the object remains unchanged when null is passed as an input.  
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object, set an initial language string, and define a null string.
  Act: Invoke the setLanguage method with the null string as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the object's language property against the initial language string.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the language remains the same when null is provided as an input. The expected result is the initial string that was set on the object, before invoking the method. This is important for ensuring that the method correctly maintains its state when a null input is provided.

Scenario 3: Setting the Language with an empty string input
Details:  
  TestName: testSetLanguageWithEmptyStringInput
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the language of the object can be set to an empty string when an empty string is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object, and define an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the setLanguage method with the empty string as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the object's language property against the empty string.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the language can be set to an empty string when given an empty string as an input. The expected result is an empty string, as this was the input. This is important for checking that the method can handle empty string inputs.
