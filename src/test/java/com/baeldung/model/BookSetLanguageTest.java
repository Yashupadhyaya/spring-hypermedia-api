================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If an exception occurs in the setter method, the standard error messages can reveal sensitive information about the system or the state of the application.
Solution: Handle exceptions properly and customize error messages to not reveal any sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The setter method does not perform any validation on the input. This can lead to issues like setting improper values, cross-site scripting (XSS) if the value is used in a web context, SQL Injection if the value is used in a SQL query, etc.
Solution: Always validate input data before using it. Use appropriate validation based on the context where the input is used.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the language member variable holds sensitive information, this could be exposed if the class is serialized or if its toString method is invoked for logging or debugging.
Solution: Avoid storing sensitive information in member variables. If it is necessary, ensure that it is properly protected when the class is serialized or when the toString method is invoked.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if the language is set correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testLanguageIsSetCorrectly
  Description: This test is meant to check if the language is correctly set when a valid language string is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid language string.
  Act: Invoke the setLanguage method with the valid language string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the language is set correctly.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the language is set correctly when a valid language string is provided. The significance of this test is to ensure that the language setting functionality works as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the language is not set when a null value is provided

Details:  
  TestName: testLanguageIsNotSetWhenNullIsProvided
  Description: This test is meant to check if the language is not set when a null value is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null language string.
  Act: Invoke the setLanguage method with the null language string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the language is not set.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the language is not set when a null value is provided. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle null inputs.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the language is not set when an empty string is provided

Details:  
  TestName: testLanguageIsNotSetWhenEmptyStringIsProvided
  Description: This test is meant to check if the language is not set when an empty string is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty language string.
  Act: Invoke the setLanguage method with the empty language string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the language is not set.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the language is not set when an empty string is provided. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle empty string inputs.
