================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-570: Expression is Always False
Issue: The check 'if (obj == null)' will always return false because the 'equals' method in Java is only called when an object is not null. This can cause unexpected behavior.
Solution: Remove the unnecessary null check in the 'equals' method.

Vulnerability: CWE-580: Clone Method Without super.clone()
Issue: The 'equals' method uses direct object casting which can lead to ClassCastException if the object isn't of the same type, this can cause application crash.
Solution: Use 'instanceof' for type checking before casting the object in the 'equals' method.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: If 'books' is null, it will throw a NullPointer exception when calling 'books.equals(other.books)'.
Solution: Add null check for 'books' before calling 'equals' method on it.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test when the same object is passed for comparison
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns true when the same object is passed for comparison.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object.
  Act: Pass the same object to the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two references to the same object are equal. This is fundamental to the contract of the equals method.

Scenario 2: Test when null is passed for comparison
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when null is passed for comparison.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object.
  Act: Pass null to the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that an object is not equal to null. This is fundamental to the contract of the equals method.

Scenario 3: Test when objects of different classes are passed for comparison
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when an object of a different class is passed for comparison.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object and an object of a different class.
  Act: Pass the different class object to the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that objects of different classes are not equal. This is important for ensuring type safety.

Scenario 4: Test when Carts with different books are passed for comparison
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentBooks
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when two Cart objects with different books are passed for comparison.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with different books.
  Act: Pass one Cart object to the equals method of the other.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two Carts with different books are not equal. This is important for ensuring data consistency.

Scenario 5: Test when Carts with different purchased status are passed for comparison
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentPurchasedStatus
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when two Cart objects with different purchased status are passed for comparison.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with different purchased status.
  Act: Pass one Cart object to the equals method of the other.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two Carts with different purchased status are not equal. This is important for ensuring data consistency.
