================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: This vulnerability arises when data input by user isn't correctly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
Solution: To prevent SQL injection, prepare statements, parametrized queries, or stored procedures should be used. Also, employ a web application firewall and scan regularly for vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: This vulnerability arises when input data isn't properly sanitized before it's inserted into HTML content and rendered by a web browser.
Solution: To prevent Cross-site scripting, HTML entities in user inputs should be escaped before displaying. Content Security Policy (CSP) should be setup properly. And user inputs should be validated and sanitized properly.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')
Issue: This can occur when an XML parser improperly processes XML input from an untrusted source that contains a reference to an external entity.
Solution: To fix XXE, either disable DTDs (Document Type Definitions), or use libraries that are not vulnerable to XXE, or patch XML processors. SAST and IAST tools can be used to detect this vulnerability.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the setTitle method assigns the correct value

  Details:  
    TestName: checkTitleAssignment.
    Description: The test is meant to check if the setTitle method correctly assigns the provided string value to the title attribute of the object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new object and initial title string to test with.
    Act: Call the setTitle method with the initial string as parameter.
    Assert: Check if the title attribute of the object equals the initial string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies whether the setTitle method correctly assigns the intended value. The test is significant because it ensures that the title attribute is correctly set up and can be properly used in other parts of the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the setTitle method overwrites the existing title value with new value

  Details:  
    TestName: overwriteExistingTitleValue.
    Description: The test is meant to check if the setTitle method can successfully overwrite an existing title with a new value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new object and set an initial value to the title. Prepare a secondary string to test with.
    Act: Call the setTitle method with the secondary string as the new title.
    Assert: Check if the title attribute of the object equals the secondary string.
  Validation: 
    This test is crucial because it ensures that the setTitle method can correctly overwrite older values, which is an expected behaviour when updating the title.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the setTitle method can handle null value

  Details:  
    TestName: checkNullTitleAssignment.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the setTitle method handles null values, as null is an acceptable value in many databases and applications.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new object.
    Act: Call the setTitle method with null as parameter.
    Assert: Check if the title attribute of the object is null.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that null values are correctly assigned to the title attribute. This is particularly important in situations where the title might be optional or not provided in certain instances.
    
Scenario 4: Test to check if the setTitle method can handle empty string

  Details:  
    TestName: checkEmptyStringTitleAssignment.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the setTitle method handles empty strings, as frontend may provide empty string as inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new object.
    Act: Call the setTitle method with empty string as parameter.
    Assert: Check if the title attribute of the object equals empty string.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that empty strings are correctly assigned to the title attribute. It verifies the program's ability to handle such edge cases.
