================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Data Modification (CWE-362)
Issue: When field setters like `setId` are publicly accessible without any control measures in place, it could allow for arbitrary object manipulations. This manipulation could then lead to data integrity issues in an application, particularly if the data is used in security-critical operations.
Solution: Impose access control measures for such setters or make them private, especially if they're modifying key fields. Filters or sanitizers can be added to ensure data being set is as expected and valid. If not required, consider making the 'id' field final to prevent its modification after object initialization.

================================================================================
"""
 Scenario 1: Null Value Test

 Details:  
TestName: checkSetIdWithNull.
Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when the provided Long id is null.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific arrangement needed since we're testing with null.
Act: Invoke setId with null value.
Assert: Check that the id of the object is null.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the method can handle null inputs gracefully. The test proves the robustness of the method.

 Scenario 2: Test with positive Long Value

 Details:  
TestName: checkSetIdWithPositiveLong.
Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when the provided Long id is a positive value.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
Act: Invoke setId with a positive Long value.
Assert: Check that the id of the object is the same as the value set.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the method works correctly with normal, positive Long input. The test confirms the correct functionality of the method.

 Scenario 3: Test with Negative Long Value

 Details:  
TestName: checkSetIdWithNegativeLong.
Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setId method when the provided Long id is a negative value.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
Act: Invoke setId with a negative Long value.
Assert: Check that the id of the object is the same as the negative value set.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the method can handle negative Long values correctly. The test validates the method's ability to handle edge case values.

 Scenario 4: Test with Max Long Value

 Details:  
TestName: checkSetIdWithMaxLong.
Description: This test verifies how the setId method behaves when the provided Long id equals Long.MAX_VALUE.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific arrangements are needed.
Act: Invoke setId with Long.MAX_VALUE.
Assert: Check that the id of the object is the same as Long.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
The assertion checks whether the method can handle very large positive Long values correctly. The test ensures that the method can handle the maximum Long value in Java.
 
 Scenario 5: Test with Min Long Value

 Details:  
TestName: checkSetIdWithMinLong.
Description: This test verifies how the setId method behaves when the provided Long id equals Long.MIN_VALUE.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific arrangements are needed.
Act: Invoke setId with Long.MIN_VALUE.
Assert: Check that the id of the object is the same as Long.MIN_VALUE.
Validation:
The assertion checks whether the method can handle very large negative Long values correctly. The test ensures that the method can handle the minimum Long value in Java.
