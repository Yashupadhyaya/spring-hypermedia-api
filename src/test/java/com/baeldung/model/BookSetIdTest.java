Scenario 1: Valid Id assignment test

Details:
  TestName: testValidIdAssignment
  Description: The test checks if the method correctly assigns a valid input id to the 'this' object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setId method, and prepare a valid Long value.
  Act: Call the setId method using the valid Long value as input.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the assigned id matches the input id value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setId method correctly assigns a given input. This is crucial since setting the right id is key to object identification and database operations, without which the application may experience erroneous behavior.

Scenario 2: Null Id assignment test

Details:
  TestName: testNullIdAssignment
  Description: The test checks how the method handles when a null value is assigned as an id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a null Long value.
  Act: Call the setId method using the null value as input.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that an exception has been thrown or null assignment has been handled as per the program logic.
Validation:
  The assertion is designed to verify how the setId method handles null value assignments. This serves as a crucial test because null values may lead to NullPointerExceptions in further operations, hence our application should be capable of handling such scenarios.

Scenario 3: Negative Id assignment test

Details:
  TestName: testNegativeIdAssignment
  Description: The test is intended to check how the method handles when a negative value is assigned as an id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and prepare a negative Long value.
  Act: Call the setId method using the negative value as input.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that an exception has been thrown or negative assignment has been handled as per the program logic.
Validation:
  The assertion for this test seeks to substantiate the handling of negative ids. This is a boundary condition as usually ids are positive and unique, hence assigning a negative id might lead to erroneous behavior in the application.
