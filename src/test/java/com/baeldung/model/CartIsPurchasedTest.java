================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: No vulnerabilities were discovered in the submitted code.
Solution: N/A

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with purchased as "true" 
Details:  
  TestName: testIsPurchasedWhenTrue. 
  Description: This test case is meant to validate when the purchased variable is true, ensuring the isPurchased method correctly returns true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the purchased variable to true.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
  Assert: The expected return value should be true.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to confirm that when the purchased variable is set to true, the isPurchased method returns true. 
  This test is crucial to ensure that isPurchased accurately reports when a purchase has been made.


Scenario 2: Test with purchased as "false"  
Details:  
  TestName: testIsPurchasedWhenFalse. 
  Description: This test case is meant to verify when the purchased variable is false, ensuring the isPurchased method correctly returns false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the purchased variable to false.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
  Assert: The expected return value should be false.
Validation:
  This assertion intends to confirm that when the purchased variable is set to false, the isPurchased method returns false.
  This test is vital for ensuring that isPurchased correctly reports when a purchase has not been made.

Scenario 3: Test initial state (assuming default of false)
Details:  
  TestName: testIsPurchasedInitialState. 
  Description: This test is designed to validate the behavior of the isPurchased method when invoked without explicitly setting the purchased variable's value. It's assumed that the default state of the purchased variable is false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set any value for the purchased variable.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
  Assert: The expected return value should be false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that by default, before any purchase process, the status of purchased is false.
  This test is important for ensuring that the isPurchased method correctly handles scenarios, confirming adherence to default behavior logic.
