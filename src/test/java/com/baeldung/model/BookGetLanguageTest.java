"""
 Scenario 1: Test to check if getLanguage method returns correct language string
 
 Details:  
    TestName: testGetLanguageCorrectness 
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the getLanguage method returns the correct language string stored in the object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object with a known language string. 
    Act: Invoke getLanguage method on the object.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with the expected string. 
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies the correctness of the getLanguage method. The expected result reflects that it should return the exact language string set during the creation of the object. The successful execution of this test ensures correct retrieval of langauge information from the system.

 Scenario 2: Test to check getLanguage method return type
 
 Details:  
    TestName: testGetLanguageReturnType 
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getLanguage method always return a String type. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object. 
    Act: Invoke getLanguage method on the object.
    Assert: Check if the returned value's type is String. 
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies the return type of the getLanguage method. The expected result is a String type. If it returns any other type, there must be an issue with the method configuration.

 Scenario 3: Test to check getLanguage method handling when language is not set i.e., null
 
 Details:  
    TestName: testGetLanguageWhenUnset 
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getLanguage method handles the scenario when the language is not set. In this case, the expected return is null or a default string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object without setting the language.
    Act: Invoke the getLanguage method on the object.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is default or null, depending on the behavior defined in the implementation. 
  Validation: 
    This assertion tests the robustness of the getLanguage method by verifying its behaviour when the language is not set. The expected result is null or default, because if the language has not been set previously, the method should either return a default string or null. This test case verifies that the method can handle such edge cases without crashing the application.
