"""
Scenario 1: Test hashCode for Book with null values

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullValues
  Description: This test is designed to validate the hashCode method when all the fields (title, isbn, author) are null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Book instance with null values for title, isbn, and author.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashcode is 1 (since all fields are null).
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the hashCode method handles null values correctly and returns a consistent value. This is important for the correct functioning of hash-based collections.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode for Book with non-null values

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullValues
  Description: This test is designed to validate the hashCode method when all the fields (title, isbn, author) have specific non-null values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Book instance with non-null values for title, isbn, and author.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hashcode is equal to the expected hashcode (calculated manually based on the field values).
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the hashCode method correctly calculates the hash based on the field values. This ensures consistent behavior in hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode consistency

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test is designed to validate that the hashCode method returns consistent results for the same object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Book instance with specific values for title, isbn, and author.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the Book instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all returned hashcodes are equal.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the hashCode method is consistent, which is a crucial requirement for the correct functioning of hash-based collections.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode for two equal Book instances

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeForEqualBooks
  Description: This test is designed to validate that two equal Book instances (based on the equals method) return the same hashcode. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two new Book instances with the same values for title, isbn, and author.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both Book instances.
  Assert: Assert that both hashcodes are equal.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that equal instances have equal hashcodes, which is a necessary condition for the correct functioning of hash-based collections.
