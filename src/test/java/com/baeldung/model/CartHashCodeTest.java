 * Scenario 1: Test when books are null and purchased is false
 * 
 * Details:
 * TestName: testHashCodeWithNullBooksAndNotPurchased.
 * Description: This test checks the hashCode method when the books list is null
 * and the purchased flag is false.
 * Execution:
 * Arrange: Set up the books list as null and the purchased flag as false.
 * Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
 * Assert: Assert that the returned hash code is 1237.
 * Validation:
 * This assertion verifies that the hash code method correctly handles null
 * values and the purchased flag. The expected result is based on the logic in
 * the hashCode method. This test is significant because it checks the edge case
 * of null values and false flags.
 * 
 * Scenario 2: Test when books are null and purchased is true
 * 
 * Details:
 * TestName: testHashCodeWithNullBooksAndPurchased.
 * Description: This test checks the hashCode method when the books list is null
 * and the purchased flag is true.
 * Execution:
 * Arrange: Set up the books list as null and the purchased flag as true.
 * Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
 * Assert: Assert that the returned hash code is 1231.
 * Validation:
 * This assertion verifies that the hash code method correctly handles null
 * values and the purchased flag. The expected result is based on the logic in
 * the hashCode method. This test is significant because it checks the edge case
 * of null values and true flags.
 * 
 * Scenario 3: Test when books are not null and purchased is false
 * 
 * Details:
 * TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullBooksAndNotPurchased.
 * Description: This test checks the hashCode method when the books list is not
 * null and the purchased flag is false.
 * Execution:
 * Arrange: Set up the books list with some books and the purchased flag as
 * false.
 * Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
 * Assert: Assert that the returned hash code is the calculated hash code based
 * on the books list and the purchased flag.
 * Validation:
 * This assertion verifies that the hash code method correctly calculates the
 * hash code when the books list is not null and the purchased flag is false.
 * The expected result is based on the logic in the hashCode method. This test
 * is significant because it checks the normal operation of the hashCode method.
 * 
 * Scenario 4: Test when books are not null and purchased is true
 * 
 * Details:
 * TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullBooksAndPurchased.
 * Description: This test checks the hashCode method when the books list is not
 * null and the purchased flag is true.
 * Execution:
 * Arrange: Set up the books list with some books and the purchased flag as
 * true.
 * Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
 * Assert: Assert that the returned hash code is the calculated hash code based
 * on the books list and the purchased flag.
 * Validation:
 * This assertion verifies that the hash code method correctly calculates the
 * hash code when the books list is not null and the purchased flag is true. The
 * expected result is based on the logic in the hashCode method. This test is
 * significant because it checks the normal operation of the hashCode method.
