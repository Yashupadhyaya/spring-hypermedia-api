================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Object References (CWE-610)
Issue: If methods that alter or return data based on an ID provided in the method parameter (like getId() method) are not properly secured, it can lead to unauthorized data disclosure or alteration.
Solution: Ensure that proper access control checks, like Authentication and Authorization, are performed before accessing or altering data in a method.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input (CWE-89, SQL Injection)
Issue: Without sufficient input validation and sanitization mechanisms, an attacker can inject malicious data leading to data breaches or manipulation.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORM libraries to ensure user input is properly sanitized before using in SQL queries. Additionally, implement strong input validation checks and practices.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure (CWE-311)
Issue: If sensitive data (like IDs, personal information) are not properly handled, it can lead to data breaches and privacy violations.
Solution: Apply the principles of 'least privilege' and 'need to know' in data handling. Make sure to encrypt sensitive data and do not expose sensitive details unnecessarily.

Vulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Credential (CWE-798)
Issue: If applications use hardcoded credentials, it can lead to unauthorized access if the code is exposed or accessed. It's not present in the submitted snippet but a common flaw.
Solution: Store credentials securely using environment variables or secure credential storage mechanisms instead of hardcoding in the application code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate return of getId method when id is present

Details:  
  TestName: validateReturnOfGetIdWhenIdExists
  Description: This test checks that the getId() method properly returns the Id that has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a specific ID to the object in the test set-up.
    Act: Call the getId() method on the object. 
    Assert: The ID returned by the getId() method should match the one assigned in the test set-up.
  Validation:  
    This ensures that the getId() method is functioning as expected in fetching the Id. This is critical as IDs are often used as unique identifiers for objects and its incorrect retrieval could cause significant problems in data operations.

Scenario 2: Validate return of getId method when Id is null

Details:  
  TestName: validateReturnOfGetIdWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test checks that when the Id is null, the getId() method appropriately returns null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not assign an ID to the object in the set-up phase.
    Act: Call the getId() method on the object.
    Assert: The getId() method should return null.
  Validation: 
    This is to verify that the getId() method handles null Ids without throwing an exception. The system should be robust enough to handle these cases since not all objects may have assigned Ids at all times.

Scenario 3: Validate the type of return value of getId method 

Details:  
  TestName: validateReturnTypeOfGetId
  Description: This test checks if the getId() method returns a value of type Long as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a specific ID to the object in the test set-up.
    Act: Call the getId() method on the object. 
    Assert:  Check the type of returned value, it should be Long.
  Validation: 
    This ensures that getId() is working as expected in terms of data types, ensuring compatibility with other parts of the code that rely on the returned Id being a Long.
