================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The 'author' attribute of the class might be exposed to external manipulation through its setter method, allowing attackers to control referencing to internal objects, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
Solution: Use access control checks or other indirect mechanisms to reference objects; reduce direct references to secure objects whenever possible. Use UUID instead of sequential IDs for reference to limit guessability. Also, consider using a data hiding technique like the Java Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure or CWE-359
Issue: If the 'author' field in the class represents sensitive data, it could be exposed to risk since it directly uses setter method that can be publicly accessed.
Solution: Use getter/setter methods to control access to class attributes. Implement input validation and consider encryption techniques when dealing with sensitive data. Also, consider strong authorization and authentication controls before allowing access to sensitive data.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through Sent Data or CWE-201
Issue: If the 'author' field of the class is a sensitive information, it might be exposed during marshalling (object-to-JSON conversion) due to direct visibility provided by the JsonView annotation.
Solution: Use '@JsonIgnore' annotation to exclude the 'author' property from serialization if it's sensitive. Alternatively, use specific views to control serialization and deserialization. Don't expose sensitive data unnecessarily.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Valid author assignment 
  
Details:  
TestName: assignValidAuthor.
Description: This test checks if the function correctly assigns a valid input to the author parameter. 
Execution:
Arrange: Create a string variable to represent a valid author name.
Act: Invoke the setAuthor method with this valid author name. 
Assert: Check the author parameter of the object and compare it to the string value you introduced. They should match.
Validation: 
This verifies that the function can correctly assign a valid name. This is important to ensure that author data in our application is correct.

Scenario 2: Author assignment with null

Details:  
TestName: assignNullAuthor.
Description: This test verifies if the function handles null input appropriately.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a null string variable.
Act: Invoke the setAuthor method with the null string. 
Assert: Check if the author parameter of the object is null.
Validation: 
This checks if the method can handle null inputs and prevent any null reference errors, ensuring the stability of the app.

Scenario 3: Author assignment with empty string

Details:  
TestName: assignEmptyAuthor.
Description: This test verifies if the function accepts an empty string as a valid argument.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an empty string variable.
Act: Invoke the setAuthor method with the empty string. 
Assert: Check if the author parameter of the object is an empty string.
Validation: 
Validates if the method can handle empty strings. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity.

Scenario 4: Author assignment with special characters

Details:  
TestName: assignAuthorWithSpecialCharacters.
Description: This test checks how the method responds to inputs containing special characters.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a string variable containing special characters.
Act: Invoke the setAuthor method with the special-character string. 
Assert: Check if the author parameter of the object matches the special-character string.
Validation: 
This checks the string encryption reliability and the app's overall functionality.
