================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Data Exposure
Issue: The data model doesn't use any form of control or validation on the data being set to its 'author' field. This could lead to potential data integrity issues or even security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
Solution: Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure only valid and safe data is being stored in the 'author' field.

Vulnerability: Potential Information Leakage
Issue: The use of @JsonIgnore and @JsonView annotations suggests that this model might be directly exposed to a JSON-based web API. This could potentially lead to sensitive information being unintentionally exposed if not used carefully.
Solution: Ensure that only necessary data is exposed via your API. Use @JsonView to limit the fields that get serialized to JSON. It might be more secure to use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for your API, rather than exposing your database entities directly.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when a valid author is provided

Details:  
  TestName: testValidAuthorInput
  Description: This test is meant to check that the method 'setAuthor' correctly sets the author attribute when a valid string is provided as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class which contains the 'setAuthor' method, and define a valid string representing an author's name.
  Act: Invoke the 'setAuthor' method with the valid author string as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of the author attribute against the input string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'setAuthor' method correctly assigns the author attribute when a valid input is provided. This is essential to ensure that the author information is correctly stored in the system.

Scenario 2: Test when a null input is provided

Details:  
  TestName: testNullAuthorInput
  Description: This test is meant to check that the method 'setAuthor' handles null input appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class which contains the 'setAuthor' method, and define a null string.
  Act: Invoke the 'setAuthor' method with the null string as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of the author attribute against null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'setAuthor' method correctly assigns the author attribute as null when a null input is provided. This is important to ensure the system can handle null inputs without crashing.

Scenario 3: Test when an empty string is provided

Details:  
  TestName: testEmptyAuthorInput
  Description: This test is meant to check that the method 'setAuthor' handles empty string input appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class which contains the 'setAuthor' method, and define an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the 'setAuthor' method with the empty string as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of the author attribute against an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'setAuthor' method correctly assigns the author attribute as an empty string when an empty string is provided as input. This ensures the system can appropriately handle empty string inputs.
