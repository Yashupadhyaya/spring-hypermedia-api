================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation CWE-20
Issue: In Java applications, vulnerabilities can manifest if input from external sources or end-users isn't properly validated and sanitized. If unchecked, it could lead to security issues like injection attacks.
Solution: To mitigate this, ensure validation is always performed on the server-side. Use existing libraries like the Apache Commons Validator that provides several validation routines which might be useful.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References CWE-22
Issue: Happens when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object such as a file, directory, or database key. Without an access control check or other protection, attackers can manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.
Solution: Avoid exposing direct object references to users whenever possible, use id references and permissions to ensure each user has access only to assigned resources.

Vulnerability: Missing or Ineffective Access Control CWE-284
Issue: Lack of the necessary access controls in place to guard critical resources and information could possibly lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or worse. This includes unsecured database interactions, and neglecting to utilize Java's built-in security features.
Solution: Incorporate role-based access control (RBAC) or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict the capabilities of potential attackers. Limit permissions on any outsourced services.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Information Exposure CWE-200
Issue: Java programs that process sensitive data could inadvertently leak this information through various means: unencrypted network communications, log files, URL parameters, etc.
Solution: Use strong encryption protocols during data transmission, Sanitize log files and debug information regularly. Employ hashing for sensitive information like passwords.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Normal Scenario 

  Details:  
    TestName: getSynopsisShouldReturnSynopsisWhenSynopsisIsNotNull.
    Description: This test will check the getSynopsis method by making sure it returns a value (non-null) when the synopsis contains a valid value (is not null). 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the synopsis variable with any arbitrary valid string value.
    Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
    Assert: The returned value from the method should be equal to the synopsis variable value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the return value of the getSynopsis method is equal to the expected value of the synopsis. It is critical for maintaining data consistency and ensuring the correctness of the Getter method.

  Scenario 2: Test for Edge Case Scenario

  Details:  
    TestName: getSynopsisShouldReturnNullWhenSynopsisIsNull.
    Description: The test will check the getSynopsis method by making sure it returns null when the synopsis is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the synopsis variable as null.
    Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
    Assert: The returned value from the getSynopsis method should be equal to null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the return value of the getSynopsis method would be null when the synopsis is null. This is important to determine appropriate handling of null values and ensure that the database won't save unwanted information.
