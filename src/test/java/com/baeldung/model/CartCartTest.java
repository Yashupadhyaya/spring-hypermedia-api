================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If book information (such as prices, ISBN, etc.) are being passed through GET requests, it can lead to information leakage.
Solution: Use POST requests to send sensitive information to the server. If that's not possible, encrypt the data before sending it.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the Book class contains sensitive information (such as customer details, personal information, etc.), and if these are not properly secured, it can lead to privacy violations.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Follow the principle of least privilege and only allow necessary access to sensitive data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if a new cart is initialized with an empty book list.

Details:  
  TestName: testCartInitialization
  Description: This test is meant to check if a new Cart object is initialized with an empty list of books. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Cart object.
  Act: Get the list of books from the Cart object.
  Assert: Assert that the list of books is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the new Cart object is initialized with an empty list of books. The expected result is based on the initial setup of the Cart constructor, which initializes an empty ArrayList of Book objects. This test ensures that the Cart constructor behaves as expected, which is crucial for the correct functioning of the shopping cart feature.

Scenario 2: Test to check null safety of the Cart constructor.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullSafetyCartConstructor
  Description: This test is designed to check if the Cart constructor can handle null values safely.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable as we are not passing any parameters to the Cart constructor.
  Act: Create a new Cart object.
  Assert: Assert that the Cart object is not null and the list of books is not null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Cart constructor does not return a null object or a null list of books. The expected result is based on the fact that constructors should not return null. This test ensures that the Cart constructor is null safe, which is important for preventing null pointer exceptions during runtime.

Scenario 3: Test to check the type of book list in the Cart constructor.

Details:  
  TestName: testTypeOfBookListInCartConstructor
  Description: This test is meant to check if the book list in a new Cart object is of type ArrayList.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Cart object.
  Act: Get the class of the book list from the Cart object.
  Assert: Assert that the class of the book list is ArrayList.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the book list in a new Cart object is an ArrayList. The expected result is based on the Cart constructor, which initializes an ArrayList of Book objects. This test ensures that the Cart constructor creates the correct type of list, which is important for the correct functioning of the shopping cart feature.
