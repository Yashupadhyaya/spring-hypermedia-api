================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: If the 'purchased' field is related to a sensitive object (e.g., a product), manipulating the value directly could lead to unauthorized access or changes to data.
Solution: Implement proper access control checks to verify the user has the correct permissions to modify the object. Avoid exposing direct references to internal identifiers.

Vulnerability: Missing Function Level Access Control or CWE-285
Issue: The 'setPurchased' method could be accessed by unauthorized users or processes, leading to undesired changes in the state of objects.
Solution: Ensure proper access controls are implemented for this method. Only authorized users should be able to access and use this function.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to set purchased to true

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetPurchasedTrue
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the method setPurchased() updates the 'purchased' field to true when passed a true argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to arrange any data or mocks since the method does not interact with any other methods or fields.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method with true as the argument.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the 'purchased' field is set to true.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify if the 'purchased' field is updated correctly when the setPurchased method is called with true. The expected result is true because that's the value we passed to the method. This test is significant to ensure the method correctly updates the 'purchased' field.

Scenario 2: Test to set purchased to false

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetPurchasedFalse
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the method setPurchased() updates the 'purchased' field to false when passed a false argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to arrange any data or mocks since the method does not interact with any other methods or fields.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method with false as the argument.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the 'purchased' field is set to false.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify if the 'purchased' field is updated correctly when the setPurchased method is called with false. The expected result is false because that's the value we passed to the method. This test is significant to ensure the method correctly updates the 'purchased' field.

Scenario 3: Test to verify default value of purchased

  Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultValueOfPurchased
    Description: This test is meant to check the default value of 'purchased' field before the setPurchased method is called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to arrange any data or mocks since the method does not interact with any other methods or fields.
    Act: Check the value of 'purchased' field before calling the setPurchased method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the 'purchased' field is set to its default value.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify if the 'purchased' field is set to its default value before setPurchased method is called. This test is significant to ensure the field 'purchased' is initialized with its default value.
