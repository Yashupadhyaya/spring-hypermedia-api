================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Object Deserialization (CWE-502)
Issue: If any part of the application deserializes this object from untrusted sources, it can lead to arbitrary code execution, as the Jackson library (used for JSON processing) is known to have this vulnerability.
Solution: Avoid deserializing objects from untrusted sources. If that's not possible, use a safe deserialization strategy like whitelisting classes that can be deserialized or use simple data types instead of complex objects.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Control (CWE-285)
Issue: The class and its methods are public, which means they can be accessed from anywhere. If there's sensitive data in this class, it can be exposed to unauthorized access.
Solution: Limit the access to the class and its methods using the appropriate access modifiers. Add proper authentication and authorization checks before accessing sensitive data.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: If the Entity class is used to directly map user input to database queries, it can lead to SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection. Never construct SQL queries using string concatenation of raw user input.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Default Constructor Test

Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultConstructor.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the default constructor for the Book class is working as expected by creating a new instance of the class. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Not required as we are testing the default constructor.
    Act: Invoke the default constructor to create a new instance of the Book class.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the new instance of the Book class is not null.
Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that a new instance of the Book class can be created using the default constructor. The expected result is that the new instance is not null. This test is significant as it confirms that an instance of the Book class can be created without any parameters, which is the basic functionality of the default constructor.

Scenario 2: Null Fields Test

Details:  
    TestName: testNullFieldsInNewInstance.
    Description: This test is meant to check if all the fields in a new instance of the Book class created using the default constructor are null. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Not required as we are testing the default constructor.
    Act: Invoke the default constructor to create a new instance of the Book class.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if all the fields in the new instance of the Book class are null.
Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that all the fields in a new instance of the Book class created using the default constructor are null. The expected result is that all fields are null. This test is significant as it confirms that the default constructor does not initialize any fields, which is the expected behavior.

Scenario 3: Non-Null Fields Test

Details:  
    TestName: testNonNullFieldsAfterSetting.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the fields in a new instance of the Book class created using the default constructor can be set to non-null values. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the Book class using the default constructor.
    Act: Set the fields in the new instance of the Book class to non-null values.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if all the fields in the new instance of the Book class are not null.
Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the fields in a new instance of the Book class created using the default constructor can be set to non-null values. The expected result is that all fields are not null. This test is significant as it confirms that the fields in an instance of the Book class can be set to non-null values after its creation, which is a basic requirement for the usage of the class.
