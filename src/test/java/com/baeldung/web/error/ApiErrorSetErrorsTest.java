================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The method 'setErrors' is directly setting the list of errors. If this list contains any sensitive information, it could be exposed to the users, leading to potential information disclosure vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure that no sensitive information is included in the error messages. If sensitive information must be included, implement proper access controls to ensure only authorized users can view these messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: The 'setErrors' method accepts a List of Strings without performing any validation on the provided input. This could lead to potential security vulnerabilities if the strings contain malicious data.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that only valid, expected strings are included in the error list. Sanitize the input to remove any potentially malicious characters.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'setErrors' method does not perform any null checks before setting the error list. This could potentially lead to NullPointerExceptions if a null value is passed as the error list.
Solution: Perform null checks before setting the error list. If a null value is passed, the method should handle it gracefully without throwing an exception.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Setting Errors with a Non-Empty List

Details:  
    TestName: testSettingErrorsWithNonEmptyList
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setErrors method accurately sets the errors when provided with a non-empty list of errors. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a non-empty list of string errors. 
    Act: Invoke the setErrors method with this list as a parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the list of errors in the class with the initial list. 
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the list of errors in the class is equivalent to the list passed as a parameter. This test is significant as it validates the core functionality of the setErrors method.

Scenario 2: Test Setting Errors with an Empty List

Details:  
    TestName: testSettingErrorsWithEmptyList
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setErrors method appropriately handles an empty list of errors. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty list of string errors. 
    Act: Invoke the setErrors method with this list as a parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the list of errors in the class is empty. 
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the list of errors in the class is empty after being set with an empty list. This test is important as it checks the method's handling of empty lists.

Scenario 3: Test Setting Errors with Null List

Details:  
    TestName: testSettingErrorsWithNullList
    Description: This test is designed to check if the setErrors method can handle a null list of errors. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Set the list of string errors to null. 
    Act: Invoke the setErrors method with this null list as a parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the list of errors in the class is null. 
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the list of errors in the class is null after being set with a null list. This test is important as it checks the method's null handling capability.
