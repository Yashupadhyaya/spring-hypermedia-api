================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-395: Exception Handling (Unchecked or Unsafe Exceptions)
Issue: The method throws a runtime exception (EntityNotFoundException) when a null entity is encountered. While this is not a security vulnerability in itself, unhandled runtime exceptions could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) if the exception propagates up the stack and crashes the application.
Solution: Catch the runtime exception at an appropriate level in your application to prevent it from crashing the entire application. Use logging to record the exception details for debugging purposes.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The 'message' parameter of the method could potentially leak sensitive information about the application's internal state. This could be exploited by an attacker to gain more information about the system and aid in further attacks.
Solution: Ensure that the 'message' parameter does not contain sensitive information. Use a generic error message for exceptions that will be visible to the end user.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: If an EntityNotFoundException is thrown, resources opened before the checkEntityExists method call might not be properly closed, leading to resource leaks.
Solution: Ensure that resources are closed in a finally block or use try-with-resources to automatically close resources.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the behavior when a non-null entity is passed
  Details:  
    TestName: testEntityExists.
    Description: This test will verify that the function behaves correctly when a non-null entity is passed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a non-null entity.
    Act: Call the checkEntityExists method with the non-null entity and a valid message.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is the same as the provided non-null entity.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that the method correctly identifies and returns non-null entities. This is crucial for the application's data integrity and business logic as it helps prevent unnecessary exceptions when operating with valid entities.

Scenario 2: Validate the behavior when a null entity is passed
  Details:  
    TestName: testEntityNotFound.
    Description: This test will verify that the function throws an EntityNotFoundException when a null entity is passed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are passing null.
    Act: Call the checkEntityExists method with null and a valid message.
    Assert: Verify that an EntityNotFoundException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that the method correctly identifies and throws an exception for null entities. This is crucial for the application's error handling and data integrity as it prevents operations on null entities.

Scenario 3: Validate the exception message when a null entity is passed
  Details:  
    TestName: testExceptionMessage.
    Description: This test will verify that the function throws an EntityNotFoundException with the correct message when a null entity is passed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a specific error message.
    Act: Call the checkEntityExists method with null and the specific error message.
    Assert: Verify that an EntityNotFoundException is thrown and that the exception message matches the one provided.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that the method correctly throws an exception with the specific message for null entities. This is crucial for the application's error reporting and troubleshooting, as it allows developers and users to understand the context of the error.
