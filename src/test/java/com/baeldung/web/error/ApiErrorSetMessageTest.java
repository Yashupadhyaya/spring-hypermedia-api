================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: If user-supplied data is not properly validated, it can lead to various forms of attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Remote Code Execution.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user-supplied data. Use prepared statements for SQL queries. Use output encoding libraries when outputting user data.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: This vulnerability can occur when user-supplied data is not properly escaped before being used in HTML output, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Use context-specific output encoding libraries when outputting user data. Make sure to apply the encoding as late as possible, ideally as the data is being outputted.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: This vulnerability can occur if sensitive information is exposed in error messages or within the application's UI.
Solution: Ensure that error messages are generic and do not reveal any sensitive information. Regularly review your code and remove any hard-coded sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: When an error message provides too much detail, it can provide a potential attacker with insight into the potential vulnerabilities of the system.
Solution: Ensure that error messages returned to the user are generic and do not reveal any sensitive information about the system's architecture or potential vulnerabilities.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the message is being set correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testMessageIsSetCorrectly.
    Description: This test checks if the message is set correctly when a valid string is passed to the method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with a valid message.
    Act: Invoke the setMessage method with the created string as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the message has been set correctly.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the message has been set correctly. The reason for the expected result is that the message should be equal to the string passed to the method. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the setMessage method.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the message is being reset correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testMessageIsResetCorrectly.
    Description: This test checks if the message is reset correctly when a different string is passed to the method after it has been set once. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with a valid message and set it. Create a second string with a different message.
    Act: Invoke the setMessage method with the second string as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the message has been reset correctly.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the message has been reset correctly. The reason for the expected result is that the message should now be equal to the second string passed to the method. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the setMessage method when it is invoked multiple times.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the message is set correctly when an empty string is passed

  Details:  
    TestName: testMessageIsSetCorrectlyWithEmptyString.
    Description: This test checks if the message is set correctly when an empty string is passed to the method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setMessage method with the empty string as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the message has been set correctly.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the message has been set correctly even if an empty string is passed. The reason for the expected result is that the message should now be equal to an empty string. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the setMessage method when it is invoked with an empty string as a parameter.
