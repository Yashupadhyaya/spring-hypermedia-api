================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The 'clearYourCart()' function seems like debug function that might have been left in production code. This can potentially be used by attackers to manipulate user data (in this case, clearing a user's shopping cart).
Solution: Remove debug code before deploying to production environment or at least restrict their access to limited scopes. Use proper logging instead of debug functions.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The function 'clearYourCart()' does not check for authorization or authentication. This can lead to unauthorized access or modification of data.
Solution: Always verify user's authentication and authorization before allowing them to perform any CRUD operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
Issue: The objects and resources utilized in the 'clearYourCart()' function do not have clear mention of their lifetime and no controlled disposal is observed. This can lead to resource leakage and slowdowns.
Solution: Ensure proper lifetime of objects (creation, utilization, disposal), especially for resources like database connections, file streams etc.

Vulnerability: CWE-862: Missing Authorization
Issue: There is no explicit authorization checks present in 'clearYourCart()'. This could allow users to perform actions they are not supposed to.
Solution: Implement proper authorization checks before performing any sensitive operations, typically through middleware or similar centralized location.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: It is not clear if CSRF protection is in place. If not, this operation is susceptible to CSRF attacks.
Solution: Make sure to implement CSRF tokens in your forms and validate them on submission. Several libraries are available for this, including Spring Security CSRF.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the cart is cleared

Details:  
  TestName: testIfCartIsCleared
  Description: The test is designed to verify if the method clearYourCart() successfully clears all the books from the cart. 
Execution:
  Arrange: We create a cart with a certain number of books in it. 
  Act: Invoke the clearYourCart() method. 
  Assert: Assert that the cart has no books in it after the clearYourCart() method has been called.
Validation: 
  This test aims to verify that the clearYourCart() method is working as expected. If the cart is not cleared, there might be complications when adding new books or calculating the total price.

Scenario 2: Test to check if cart purchased status is reset

Details:  
  TestName: testIfCartPurchaseStatusIsReset
  Description: This test is meant to check if the flag cartPurchased is set to false after the clearYourCart() method is invoked. 
Execution:
  Arrange: We create a cart and set the flag cartPurchased to true (indicating a purchase has happened). 
  Act: Invoke the clearYourCart() method. 
  Assert: Assert that the flag cartPurchased is false after the clearYourCart() method has been called.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the flag cartPurchased is reset to false whenever the cart is cleared. This flag is necessary to avoid double billing and other potential issues.

Scenario 3: Test to check if method works with an empty cart

Details:  
  TestName: testIfMethodWorksWithEmptyCart
  Description: This test aims to check if the clearYourCart() method works without throwing any exceptions when invoked on an already empty cart.
Execution:
  Arrange: We create an empty cart. 
  Act: Invoke the clearYourCart() method. 
  Assert: Assert that no exceptions were thrown while executing the method.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the clearYourCart() method handles all scenarios, including edge cases, without causing unexpected behaviour or exceptions.
