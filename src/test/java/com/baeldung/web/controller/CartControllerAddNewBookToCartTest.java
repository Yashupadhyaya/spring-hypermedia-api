================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
Issue: The method addNewBookToCart uses a @RequestBody parameter to get data from the request body directly. If not validated properly, malicious users can modify object attributes that are not intended to be changed.
Solution: Implement validation mechanisms on input data, such as @Valid/@Validate annotations on the request body parameter, with corresponding validation annotations in the NewBookResource class.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: There are no checks on the number of books that can be added to the cart. If a user adds a huge number of books, it can lead to the service running out of resources.
Solution: Implement a maximum limit on the number of books that can be added to a cart, to prevent resource exhaustion.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The 'isbn' used in the method findByIsbn seems to be directly passed into an SQL query. If not handled properly, an attacker can execute SQL injection to manipulate the query.
Solution: Use Prepared statements or Hibernate's Criteria API to secure the SQL query, as these methods neutralize special SQL elements, preventing SQL injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The method addNewBookToCart allows any logged in user to add any book to any cart. If the book's privacy settings are not considered, this might lead to unauthorized addition of books to carts.
Solution: Ensure a Check for the book's privacy settings before allowing a user to add it to a cart.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Add a valid book to the cart

Details:  
    TestName: addValidBookToCart.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of adding a valid book to the cart. The targeted scenario is where the isbn corresponds to an existing book in the repository. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to return a valid Book when findByIsbn is called with the test book's isbn.
    Act: Invoke addNewBookToCart method with a valid NewBookResource.
    Assert: Ensure cart contains the book added.
  Validation: 
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify that the book was successfully added to the cart. The expected result is based on the correct execution of the add method of the Cart object.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in warranting that the method correctly adds a book to the cart when given a valid book.

Scenario 2: Add an invalid book to the cart

Details:  
    TestName: addInvalidBookToCart.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of adding an invalid book to the cart. The targeted scenario is where the isbn does not correspond to an existing book in the repository. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to return null when findByIsbn is called with the test book's isbn.
    Act: Invoke addNewBookToCart method with a NewBookResource having an invalid book.
    Assert: Ensure that Checks.checkEntityExists throws an exception.
  Validation: 
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify that an exception is thrown when trying to add an invalid book. The expected result is based on the behavior of the checkEntityExists method when it encounters null.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in checking the method's error handling of non-existing books.
    
Scenario 3: Add a null book to the cart

Details:  
    TestName: addNullBookToCart.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles adding a null book to the cart. The targeted scenario is where the NewBookResource object is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data is required as the input will be null.
    Act: Invoke addNewBookToCart method with null.
    Assert: Ensure that a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify that an exception is thrown when trying to add a null book. The expected result is based on the lack of handling for null input in the method.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in examining the method's null handling capabilities.
