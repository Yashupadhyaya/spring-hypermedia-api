================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL command
Issue: The function 'findByIsbnFiltered' is using a variable 'isbn' directly within the query without any proper validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to SQL Injection, an attacker could manipulate the query by passing sql commands as 'isbn'.
Solution: Proper validation of inputs should be implemented. Use PreparedStatement or parameterized queries for database access. Avoid concatenating user input directly into query string.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site
Issue: The function 'findByIsbnFiltered' is creating a URL 'addNewBookToCart' with input parameters. If not properly validated, this can lead to URL Redirection attacks or Open Redirect.
Solution: Always validate and escape URL parameters and never use direct user input to construct URLs. If redirection is necessary, ensure to use a list of pre-approved URLs.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
Issue: In the function 'findByIsbnFiltered', user supplied data 'fields' is used in generating JSON response without proper validation or escaping. This could potentially lead to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Perform proper validation and escaping of user-supplied input before using in page generation. Preferably use libraries or frameworks that automatically escape user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
Issue: In the function 'findByIsbnFiltered', user supplied data 'isbn' is used in fetching file from system. If not validated properly, this can lead to Directory Traversal attacks.
Solution: Avoid using user supplied data for file operations. If necessary, validate and sanitize the input before use. Enforce directory or path based access controls.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Error message 'No book found for isbn = ' may reveal internal details useful for intruders. Though not a direct vulnerability, it can aid in further attacks.
Solution: Avoid providing detailed system information in error messages. Keep them generic and log the details in internal server logs for debugging.

Scenario 1: Valid ISBN and Fields
TestName: findByIsbnFilteredWithValidIsbnAndFields
Description: The test aims to validate the method findByIsbnFiltered with valid ISBN and fields.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid ISBN, fields, and a corresponding book.
    Act: Invoke findByIsbnFiltered with the valid ISBN and fields.
    Assert: The returned book's MappingJacksonValue has the correct fields and the filter's properties are set correctly.
Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the method correctly fetches and filters the corresponding book for the given valid ISBN and fields. This test is significant because it verifies the method's primary functionality.

Scenario 2: Invalid ISBN
TestName: findByIsbnFilteredWithInvalidIsbn
Description: This test is intended to validate the findByIsbnFiltered method when provided an invalid ISBN.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an invalid ISBN and any fields.
    Act: Invoke findByIsbnFiltered with the invalid ISBN.
    Assert: An exception is thrown.
Validation:
    The validation verifies that the method handles non-existent books properly. It's important to cover this error handling case.

Scenario 3: Null Fields
TestName: findByIsbnFilteredWithNullFields
Description: The test aims to validate the method findByIsbnFiltered when provided with null fields.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid ISBN and null fields.
    Act: Invoke findByIsbnFiltered with the valid ISBN and null fields.
    Assert: The returned book's MappingJacksonValue is not filtered, meaning it contains all properties.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the method correctly returns an unfiltered book for a valid ISBN and null fields. This case tests the method's response to incomplete input.

Scenario 4: Empty Fields
TestName: findByIsbnFilteredWithEmptyFields
Description: This test is designed to validate the findByIsbnFiltered method's response to empty fields.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid ISBN and empty fields.
    Act: Invoke findByIsbnFiltered with the valid ISBN and empty fields.
    Assert: The returned book's MappingJacksonValue is filtered out completely, i.e., contains no properties.
Validation:
    The validation ensures that the method correctly returns an empty book for a valid ISBN and empty fields, highlighting its function in filtering properties.
