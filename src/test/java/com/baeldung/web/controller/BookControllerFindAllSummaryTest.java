================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Injection attacks (CWE-79)
Issue: If user-supplied data is not properly validated or escaped, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code into queries (SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, etc.).
Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries, validate inputs, and properly escape outputs.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-829)
Issue: An attacker may manipulate references to gain unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Avoid exposing direct object references. If it's needed, ensure to include access control checks to validate that the user is authorized to access the requested object.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)(CWE-79)
Issue: If reflecting user data into HTTP responses without proper validation or escaping, the application might be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
Solution: Escape all user-supplied data before rendering and validate inputs where it's possible. Use content security policies to restrict sources of script execution.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)(CWE-352)
Issue: Without proper protection, an attacker might trick a user into executing unwanted actions in their security context.
Solution: Ensure that all state-changing operations are protected with CSRF tokens. The Spring Security library has built-in support for CSRF protection.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling (CWE-209)
Issue: Unnecessary information in error messages may reveal internal implementation details which can be used by an attacker for exploiting the system.
Solution: Define a global error handling mechanism to present a generic error message, without exposing sensitive system-level details. Log the original error message properly in the server log for troubleshooting.

"""
  Scenario 1: Validate the checklist of Books
  Details:  
    TestName: testCheckListOfBooks
    Description: A test to verify if the findAllSummary() method is able to fetch the list of all books correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The mock of BookRepository should be created and findAll() should return a list with a known set of Book objects.
    Act: Call the findAllSummary() with the repo object.
    Assert: Assert that the result of findAllSummary() returns the same objects as were persistently stored in the BookRepository mock.
  Validation: 
    This will verify if the findAllSummary() method returns the correct and complete list of all book resources based on the data available in the book repository. 

  Scenario 2: Test for an empty repository 
  Details: 
    TestName: testEmptyRepository 
    Description: This test aims to check if the findAllSummary() method is able to handle an empty repository scenario gracefully. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: A mock BookRepository should be created and findAll() should return an empty list. 
    Act: Call the findAllSummary() with the repo object. 
    Assert: Assert that the result of findAllSummary() is an empty list. 
  Validation:
    This test will verify that the findAllSummary() method correctly handles the scenario where the book repository is empty and still returns a valid (empty) list.

  Scenario 3: Test for null repository 
  Details: 
    TestName: testNullRepository 
    Description: This test targets to check if the findAllSummary() method is able to handle a null repository scenario without breaking. 
  Execution: 
    Arrange: The BookRepository should be set to null. 
    Act: Try to call the method findAllSummary() with the repo object. 
    Assert: Assert that the result of findAllSummary() is a null or check if correct exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test will validate that the findAllSummary() method manages null repositories effectively, thereby confirming the robustness of the method in different edge-case scenarios.

  Scenario 4: Validate the conversion of books to book resources
  Details:  
    TestName: testBookToResourceConversion
    Description: A test to verify if the books retrieved from the book repository are correctly converted to book resources in the findAllSummary() method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The mock of BookRepository should be created and findAll() should return a list with a known set of Book objects.
    Act: Call the findAllSummary() with the repo object.
    Assert: Assert that each BookResource in the result of findAllSummary() is correctly created from the corresponding Book object.
  Validation: 
    This will test the correct behavior of the BookResource::new reference method and ensures that the conversion from books to book resources in findAllSummary() method is accurate.

// ********RoostGPT********
In this updated test case, instead of using the constructor to set the `BookRepository`, a setter method is used to do the same.

Please note that, if you choose the second approach, it also requires modifying the `BookController` class to add the setter method. The modification would be:
