ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=clearYourCart_2941652865

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: The method `clearYourCart` directly interacts with `cart` object without validating the user. This approach can lead to an attacker possibly manipulating another user's cart.
Solution: Implement a user check to make sure the user interacting with the cart is the actual owner of it.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If user input is accepted and reflected back without proper encoding or escaping, it can be manipulated to execute JavaScript code in the user's browser.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate user inputs. Use libraries such as OWASP Java Encoder for HTML encoding to prevent XSS.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection
Issue: If user-supplied input is used in SQL queries without sanitization, it could lead to a SQL injection attack.
Solution: Always sanitize user inputs and use prepared statements or parameterized queries.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependencies
Issue: The use of outdated or insecure third-party libraries can introduce vulnerabilities into the application.
Solution: Regularly check and update the third-party libraries in use and review their security patches.

  Scenario 1: Clear Cart with Books Successfully 

  Details:  
    TestName: testClearCartWithBooksSuccessfully.
    Description: This test will validate if the clearYourCart() method is able to clear the cart when it has books.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart with books added and set purchased as true.
    Act: Invoke clearYourCart() method.
    Assert: Verify the Cart is empty and purchased is set to false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that after calling clearCart() the cart is empty and purchased is set to false, 
    and as the test passes, it signifies that the cart clearing functionality is working as expected. 

  Scenario 2: Clear Empty Cart Successfully 

  Details:  
    TestName: testClearEmptyCartSuccessfully.
    Description: This test will check if the clearYourCart() method is able to handle an empty cart without throwing exceptions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a cart with no books added and set purchased as true.
    Act: Invoke clearYourCart() method.
    Assert: Verify the Cart is empty and purchased is set to false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that even if the cart is empty, calling clearCart() does not throw an error.
    The test is significant as it confirms that the application can gracefully handle edge cases without crashing. 

  Scenario 3: Clear Cart when Cart is Null 

  Details:  
    TestName: testClearCartWhenCartIsNull.
    Description: This test will check if the clearYourCart() method can handle a null Cart object without throwing exceptions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a null Cart object.
    Act: Invoke clearYourCart() method.
    Assert: Verify the correct exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The aim is to ensure that clearYourCart() method throws a NullPointerException when the cart object is null.
    The significance of this test is to confirm that the application can prevent a Null Pointer Exception and provide useful error messages.
